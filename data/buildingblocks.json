API hubs and marketplaces provide the directory model introduced by ProgrammableWeb, but provide other management and profile tools for both API proviers and consumers. &nbsp;These companies are just getting going, but already offer some very interesting approaches to API discovery that go beyond just finding your API(s).</p>",
