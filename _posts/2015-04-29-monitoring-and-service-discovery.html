<p>At Mandrill, API uptime is essential.We have to ensure all the pieces of our architecture are happy and healthy.When theyre not, we need to take them away quickly and automagically so they dont negatively impact our users.We accomplish the automagic bits using some off-the-shelf tools and our own homegrown tooling we call Pulse.Configuration management has seen massive improvements recently.</p>
