<p>The hardest part of working with APIs can be the differences between them.Consensus has developed around response formats, URL patterns, meaningful HTTP verbs, and even OAuth to an extent.But for every inch of progress there are new challenges: versioning schemes, variations in OAuth implementations, pagination patterns, and continued generalized idiosyncrasy.In building our API catalog our mission has been to restore focus on data, making it easy to explore and preview API resources.Actual integration however is still another matter.</p>
