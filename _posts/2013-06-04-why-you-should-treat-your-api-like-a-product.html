<p>We at Mashery specialize in API management and to us that means that APIs should be treated as products.  This is not something that is obvious.  An API can seem like an obscure piece of programming, but if treated properly, it is not only a powerful piece of technology, but also a powerful business tool.  In order to fully explore this topic, we are launching an “API as Products” blog series, of which this is the first of several weekly posts.APIs allow a company to share its data and services in an easy to consume format and therefore allow for it to expand its reach, make partnerships easier, and create new revenue channels.</p>
