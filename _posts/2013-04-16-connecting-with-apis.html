<p>Wendy Lea fell in love with the idea of creating, driving and connecting the meaningful conversations between companies and their customers.She found a home doing that as the CEO of Get Satisfaction, a community-based platform that helps companies engage with their customers and in turn, gain product insight and enhanced customer loyalty.According to Lea, who spoke at the Business of APIs conference in San Francisco last Fall, APIs were the company’s “secret sauce” that helped elevate Get Satisfaction away from being a destination site or a place where data would just go to collect and die. 
“I wanted to be aligned with the business process, and I wanted to make sure conversations could be naturally and easily integrated into transactional data,” Lea said.Lea soon realized that API strategy was going to be key.</p>
