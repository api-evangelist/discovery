<p>The car has gone mobile. Well, alright, more mobile as telecommunications companies (telcos) like AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint are entering the space to help make the car smarter. The mobile car goes well beyond the seemingly mundane hands-free calling and texting.It now includes full diagnostic systems to keep drivers in tune with the internal happenings of their cars and infotainment systems linking popular social applications, music and video services.Furthermore, the GPS not only gets drivers to their destination, it also tells them where they might want to stop along the way, and—in the event of an emergency—has the ability to communicate with emergency services when the driver cannot.</p>
