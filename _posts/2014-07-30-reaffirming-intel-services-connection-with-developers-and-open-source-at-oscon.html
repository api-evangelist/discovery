<p>O’Reilly’s Open Source Convention (OSCON) is a premier open source developer conference that has been running for 15 years and draws developers from around the country and internationally.This year, more than four thousand developers attended the various workshops, technical sessions, and expo hall over a five-day period in Portland, Oregon.As a key player in the open source and developer communities, Intel Services had a large presence at the conference to foster our connection with developers and evangelize the Mashery™ API network, as well as reinforce Intel advocacy and leadership in open source code.Developer Engagement – The API Challenge
The  Intel® Mashery™ Developer Platform Services  team frequently attends hackathons around the world to evangelize the  Intel® Mashery™ API network  of more than 40 public APIs, and OSCON was no exception.This year we did so in a new format by running an  API challenge  from the Intel Services expo booth.</p>
