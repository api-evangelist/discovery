<p>The single most distinguishing factor of the current business environment may be its dynamism—on any given day, there are wild market fluctuations, emerging opportunities and drastic platform shifts.Just to survive, let alone thrive, every enterprise needs to have the flexibility to shift accordingly, and do it fast.In other words, it needs to scale.   
Just think how things used to be—there was essentially one operating system, IT made all the decisions on hardware acquisition and software deployment, and new implementations were phased in gradually, with adequate training and orientation.Security and integration were mostly back-end issues, and user behaviors evolved over time, not overnight.</p>
