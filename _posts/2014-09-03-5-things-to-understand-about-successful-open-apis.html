<p>This guest post comes from Intel’s Chuck Freedman API Strategist and Director of Vertical Insights, always looking at the benefits of APIs from many perspectives.Take a closer look at the recently celebrated and deservedly promising Uber Open API launch and you won’t see a free-for-all service.There’s nothing about this platform, or any successful platform for that matter, that says “Here are our APIs and do whatever with them you please.”
To launch a successful platform, the true use of Open in the API sense is to selectively expose the very same services, content or data a company uses itself.This is motivated by partner demand and a calculated understanding that the platform can ultimately offer something of value to those outside the organization.</p>
