<p>Google has patched a security vulnerability that could allow an attacker to compromise accounts associated with a wide number of Google services, including Gmail, YouTube, AdSense and Google Plus.As detailed by Threatpostss Michael Mimoso, the vulnerability affected developers who have authorized access to their accounts through Google API Explorer, a tool that allows developers to interact with Google APIs through a Web-based interface.To exploit the vulnerability, Google API Explorer users would need to be lured to a malicious website where they could be tricked into clicking on a button in an iFrame.That button would then execute a malicious action using a call to the API Explorer.Paulos Yibelo, the researcher who identified the vulnerability, noted that such clickjacking attacks are easily thwarted with the use of an X-Frame-Options HTTP response header, but they are often underestimated, giving would-be attackers opportunity to do damage.</p>
