<p>I want to access an external Google API through a GAS trigger.Is it possible/advisable to use something like the javascript Google API client library, adapted for the GAS context, instead of manually using URL Fetch, as mentioned here?PS.I am trying to hit the Google App Engine TaskQueue service via its REST API.In the Apps Script Code Editor, under the RESOURCES, ADVANCED GOOGLE SERVICES menu, you can enable different APIs.</p>
