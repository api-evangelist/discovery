<p>Communicating the value of your API is a simple, but often missed, step that can position your platform incredibly well among partners.How you describe the value of your offering is important messaging that should inform visiting partners and developers why your API is worth exploring and how it brings the missing content or service to their business and/or application.What were once no-frills landing pages to API access and documentation, API portal homepages now must greet partners and developers alike, carrying the same exciting proposition that your business development and evangelism teams do.While providing a streamlined on ramp to developers, visitors to your site must also understand why your API products are worthwhile.There are no set rules on how much or how little you need to say.</p>
