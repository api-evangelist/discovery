<p>We’ve been talking a lot on this blog about treating your API as a product and all of what that entails.  One aspect of API programs that is often overlooked is the treatment of your users – if your API is a product, its users should be treated just like all of your customers are treated.  Every user of your API, whether it’s an internal employee, an external partner or a 3rd party developer, should feel as if they are your customers.  Your API customers need to be supported throughout all their interactions with your program, from when they register through their successful integration of your API.Registration
Sometimes, registering for an API program is the hardest part of actually using the API.</p>
