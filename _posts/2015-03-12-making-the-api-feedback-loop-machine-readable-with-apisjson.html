If you are following some of my recent stories, I’m heavily focused on APIs.json, as I work to organize my own stack of microservices, using APIs.son and Swagger.I’m working hard to define additional, machine readable layers to my microservices index that answer as many of the questions that I have about the microservices and APIs that I depend on.The first machine readable definition I include in any APIs.</p>
