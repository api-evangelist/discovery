<p>Much like everything associated with your company, your API and its portal site are an extension of your content, products or services.The API deserves a worthy home where your API users and customers, your partners and developers, will see a well-supported product and understand why it’s valuable to their business.Launch with an effective presentation of your API product
Imagine if you come across a product online with no description.Or say you’re interested in buying something, but the company’s site has little more than a logo – or an existing, but empty blog.And if the product is borderline technical, how quickly would you move on if that product has no method of support?</p>
