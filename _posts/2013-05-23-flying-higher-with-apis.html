<p>Flying – it seems we all have a love-hate relationship with flying and the airlines that operate our flights.  For many of us, there is no way to get around having to fly, whether for business or vacation, so we can’t avoid the airlines.  Thankfully for frequent flyers, airlines have been trying to make things a bit easier – most of the major airlines now have put out an app that allows you to check-in to your flight, load your boarding pass, select your seat, etc.For those of us who like self-service nothing could be better than app that let’s us take care of ourselves.  Airlines, however, need to do more.</p>
