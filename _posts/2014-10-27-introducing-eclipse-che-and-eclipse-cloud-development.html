<p>This morning at EclipseCon Europe, we announced the creation of Eclipse Che, an open source platform for the creation of cloud development tooling.A large portion of Codenvy has been contributed as part of this project and we will have nearly 35 engineering resources dedicated to the ongoing improvement of Che.Separately, the Eclipse Foundation has announced the formation of a new Top Level Project named Eclipse Cloud Development (ECD).ECD is an initiative to create technologies, platforms, and tools necessary to enable the delivery of highly integrated cloud development and cloud developer environments.ECD includes Eclipse Che and also projects from IBM, SAP and Pivotal.</p>
