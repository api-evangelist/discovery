<p>02 Mar 2015   
A topic Ive written about before, and one that I answer regularly on forums, via email, and on Twitter is, “Are there any write APIs in the federal government?” It is a valid question, and as I said in my strategy suggestions for the federal government, write APIs are a critical aspect of all of this moving forward in a healthy way.Rebecca Williams (@internetrebecca) pointed me to a recent discussion on this topic earlier today, to which I added a couple of suggestions, but ultimately it is something I would like to see a more progressive solution emerge, something that can answer it real-time, and change as the API inventory in the federal government changes and evolves.Keeping a list, like 18F is doing, is a start, but we need more.One of the side projects that I work on a couple of hours each week, is the profiling of federal government APIs using APIs.</p>
