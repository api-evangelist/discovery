<p>Many people agree that developer outreach is a key component of API program success for anything from mobile enablement to digital distribution – we’ve seen this happen in companies like Edmunds, Best Buy, and Rotten Tomatoes, to name a few.But as easy as it is to follow the trend and ramp up developer outreach efforts, it’s important to first ask the question – Why do you want to engage developers?When you think about the why, you begin to ask, with whom do you want to engage (audience), and how does that engagement help you acquire users/customers/revenue/whatever metric you choose (ROI)?With developers, the if you build it they will come concept doesnt tend to work well.They look for a compelling value proposition.</p>
