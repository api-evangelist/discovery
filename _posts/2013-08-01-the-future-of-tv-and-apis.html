<p>The future of TV has been a very popular topic recently.  With Netflix putting out original content that is getting Emmy recognition, Aereo winning legal battles against the major networks, Google releasing Chromecast and Intel jumping in with its own TV service, there is more and more discussion about the end of television, as we know it. 
Traditional television viewing is changing.  Over 80% of people now do something else while watching TV: top activities include browsing the web, checking email, texting and checking social media.  Media providers are catching on – the 2nd screen trend is growing, with the likes of Kia, Toyota, Lexus and Jaguar sponsoring 2nd screen experiences for some of USA Network’s original shows.</p>
