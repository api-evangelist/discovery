<p>This post originally appeared on the Strategy Services blog. 
On the Strategy Services team, we spend a great deal of time and effort keeping our fingers on the pulse of the API and tech industry. We’re sure you do too, otherwise why would you be here reading this? It can’t be for my witty quips—they’re just not that clever. But, for even the most serial tech readers out there, the rate with which the industry moves is just astonishing; new start ups, acquisitions, emerging technologies, APIs and apps that seemingly spring up out of nowhere can all be a bit much to track.</p>
