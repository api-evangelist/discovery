<p>Today is a very special beginning for me, for my fellow Masherites and really for anyone who has ever used an API, which I can assure you, is every one of you.This is “Day One” for Mashery as an Intel company.What this means is that Mashery is becoming part of Intel’s vision for creating an open ecosystem of software and services capable of accelerating innovation with Intel technology insideⓇ.Over the past few weeks I have had many conversations with senior management at Intel.The Software Services Group has been driving a variety of service offerings over the course of the last decade.</p>
