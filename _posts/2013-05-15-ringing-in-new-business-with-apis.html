<p>APIs have helped the The Yellow Pages Group Canada (YPG) go from phonebooks to an online communications giant with exponential and continued growth. YPG began life as a directory publisher for Bell Canada in 1908.The company distributed ad-supported phone books across Canada, until the rise of the Internet made this business model obsolete. Recognizing the need to transition away from print publications, YPG digitized its directory and then went one step further by enlisting Mashery to help launch YellowAPI.Brad Wing, Head of YellowAPI, and Jonathan Lavoie-Lévesque, Senior Product Manager, will be sharing more on how the digital transformation of YPG has accelerated through its open public API platform with a free Mashery webinar on May 30.</p>
