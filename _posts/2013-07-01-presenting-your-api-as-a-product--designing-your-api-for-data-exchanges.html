<p>It is impractical to rationalize the impact of these data-exchanges without having a model to use in discussing the what’s, the how’s, and most importantly, the why’s.What’s:  Data allows for the exchange of ideas and desires across time and space
How’s: If Apps grant wishes, then data, and the APIs they flow through, are the magic fairy dust that brings wishes to reality.Why’s: to communicate and influence the process by which people assign value and relevance to data to avoid being dismissed as noise
In this post, I am going to present a framework for thinking about your data and to outline why APIs should be aware of the ways that people interact with the data.Environmental Awareness and Data Processing
The human mind is an amazing piece of computational machinery, sifting through near-infinite quantities of sensory stimulus at any given moment to identify what is truly valuable and relevant.If you want an example of how this works, try taking a walk outside and just listen to the ambient sights, sounds, and colors that present themselves to you.</p>
