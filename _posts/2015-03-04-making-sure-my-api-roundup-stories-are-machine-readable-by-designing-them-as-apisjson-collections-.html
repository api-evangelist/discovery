Making a list of valuable APIs has been a staple of my tech blogging for 10 years now, and as I work to find even more meaningful ways of defining the API space, I’m pushing the envelope on how I do API roundup stories.Instead of just finding a handful of valuable APIs, and providing an HTML list of them, Im going to use APIs.json, to make sure all of my collections are machine readable by default.For each API I profile, it is valuable to have a nice logo, name, short description, and a link to the developer portal.However I want to also make sure other valuable, machine readable resources are also present like Twitter, Github, and Blog RSS.</p>
