<p>Bryan Buchanan, our friend and frequent Sparkart collaborator over at Resen, had this to say about Storyteller today.We think he’s spot on.jQuery has been instrumental in simplifying JavaScript.It’s helped millions of developers — of all skill levels — keep pace and focus on their websites, rather than differences between browsers.Likewise, Storyteller tackles many of the hurdles developers currently face when working with APIs.</p>
