<p>This post originally apeared on the Mashery Developer Blog where our Developer Evangelists recount the best stories from Hackathons they attend around the world.  
ToorCamp is a unique hacker camping event which occurs every other year in remote Neah Bay, Washington. As a developer evangelist, ToorCamp interested me because 1,000 or so hackers, makers, engineers and software types make the trip and I wanted to see what it was all about.While I was out there I dressed like a yeti and threw the world’s first “Mashquatch Survival Hack” to challenge these wilderness hackers to show me their best survival projects.It was a unique experience.</p>
