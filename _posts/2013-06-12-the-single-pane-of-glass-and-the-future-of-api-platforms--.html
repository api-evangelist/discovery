<p>It’s been a fun ride since joining Mashery in the early days of 2008 and being part of our growth and the success of our customers.  We’ve launched well over 200 API programs over the years, and I’ve had a front row seat to many of them.  Some of our client friends at those early customer projects have been promoted given the success of their visions.  That’s super rewarding to have been a part of. 
  Over the past year or so, I’m starting to see a new phase emerge in at least a few industries: retail, media, and travel.</p>
