<p>With the Bluemix Private Catalog, delivered through our Cloud Integration service, developers in your organization can discover, bind and use your APIs as a service from the Bluemix Catalog.This articles shows the simple steps to
 * create an API from an on-premises database table
 * publish an API as a Private Service and
 * discover, bind and use the API in an application.You can easily create REST APIs using Cloud Integration from on-premises databases, applications, existing REST or Web Services, Cast Iron Live orchestrations and other Bluemix applications.You can expose APIs created from any of these sources as a Private Service in Bluemix Catalog.In this example we will build a REST API from an on-premises database.</p>
