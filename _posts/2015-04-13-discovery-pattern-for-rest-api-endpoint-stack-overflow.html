<p>I m actually studying Microservice architecture pattern and it seems that the API Gateway pattern uses the Discovery pattern, but with REST API endpoints.Can anybody explain me how it works for example if my API Gateway is NodeJS based and my REST APIs are Java written?I dont really know how can I implement this pattern and I dont find any code or schema to help me understand a bit more.Thanks for advance</p>
