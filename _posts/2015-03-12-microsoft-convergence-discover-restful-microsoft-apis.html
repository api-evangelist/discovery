<p>According to 451 Research Cloud Elements is the “missing link between API Management and iPaaS ” – or more literally, the catalyst for a “convergence” of the two spaces.The timing of this report lines up perfectly with our preparations for the  Microsoft “Convergence” event.This conference is focused  on the convergence of business leaders and visionaries, the convergence of Microsoft solutions and Partner Technologies, and the convergence of community and customers.We’re excited to bring our one-to-many API approach to Microsoft Convergence 2015.After a long battle with SOAP integrations, Cloud Elements now brings all Microsoft’s Cloud Products together under one RESTful umbrella.</p>
