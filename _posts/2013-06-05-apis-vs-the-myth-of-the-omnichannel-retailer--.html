<p>Yesterday’s article in the Wall Street Journal, titled “The Myth of the Omnichannel Retailer,” illuminated some startling facts about how many retailers are reaching their omnichannel potential.According to the a survey of 35 large retailers (more than $1B annual revenue) conducted by SD Retail Consulting, the gap between ideal omnichannel experience and execution is in reality still quite significant.Only 29% of U.S.retailers allow online orders to be picked up in stores; only 18% have mobile commerce; and 80% say they aren’t sufficiently training store associates to serve customers who purchase from multiple channels such as in store or online.</p>
