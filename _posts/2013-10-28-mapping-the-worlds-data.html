<p>We’ve worked with APIs for years at Sparkart, from deep custom SOAP integrations within our apps to many lightweight implementations of Tweets, maps, photostreams, etc.within websites.Today we source content exclusively from APIs rather than directly from a database.In the conventional RESTful API that speaks JSON we’ve found a lingua franca for content on the web.Social media, ecommerce sites, specialized databases, proprietary systems, and even the traditional CMS are all resources that we can leverage in our projects.</p>
