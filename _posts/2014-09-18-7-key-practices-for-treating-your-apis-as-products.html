<p>We are excited to have Joe Takeuchi, API Sales Engineer at VerticalResponse, share his thoughts about APIs as products with the Intel Services audience.Learn more about VerticleResponse here and see what they have to say on Twitter. 
Building an API is a huge undertaking, but developing a program around it and making it a viable product is a challenge in and of itself.In successful API programs, companies have learned to treat their APIs as standalone products with their own audience and to carve out new revenue streams.At Vertical Response, we’ve taken the time to carefully and thoroughly understand the developer’s journey with our API to best implement optimal and effective product marketing around it.</p>
