<p>Three months ago we announced that Hacker League, the hack management platform designed to help organizers run and manage hackathons, had joined the Mashery family.Today, we are thrilled to announce that Hacker League Enterprise is now available as a beta program for customers of Intel Enterprise API Management who purchase premium Developer Platform Services.Built by developers for developers, Hacker League has over the last couple years built an amazing credibility among developers and hackathon organizers - ranging from collegiate hackathons (think Major League Hacking) to the likes of Evernote, Foursquare and The Next Web.What is Hacker League Enterprise Beta  
Hacker League Enterprise is designed for companies that want to take advantage of all the great features they’ve come to expect from Hacker League, but on their own private instance of the software for internal hackathons or private partner challenges.Of course, the public version of Hacker League will remain available for  free.</p>
