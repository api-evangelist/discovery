Im continuing my work, to help people understand what APIs.json is, and the varying ways that it can be put to use.My post the other week, breaking down Fitbits APIs.json file is a good example of where to get started, and as a follow-up I wanted to help further set the bar for what a minimum viable APIs.jsonÂ looks like, and today, I am going in the other direction--toward my dream APis.</p>
