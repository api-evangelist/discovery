<p>07 Apr 2015   
I’m back doing more work on the master stack of microservices that I use to operate API Evangelist.Things were getting critical, as I needed some new features, and since I had put a moratorium on the legacy stack, in order to get the new stuff I wanted, I had to finish the migration for any API I wanted to work on—I’m currently about 70% complete with it all.One of the features I added to my API microservice (yes I went there), which is my microservice for tracking on APIs across the sector, was a set of Swagger import / export endpoints.I wanted a quick way to import Swagger to represent any API, and then easily get an updated version of Swagger out of the system as well, so I added two endpoints:
Swagger 2.0 Import (POST) - Ability to pass a public URL for a Swagger definition, and it will import into my main database.</p>
